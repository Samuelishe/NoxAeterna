## Current Checkpoint

- V1 chart visual design is accepted.
- V2 semantic shell and theme migration is accepted.
- T1-A repository documentation foundation is complete at checkpoint commit `77538a6157e269cde20b26ae3fa72764231a3858`.
- T1-B implementation is complete, and hosted run `30619151450` passed documentation validation, Windows/Linux/macOS milestone tests, and diagnostic coverage with four expected artifacts.
- The same-day session-log rollover is complete; finished July 31 evidence is retained in indexed partial-day archive part 01.
- T2-A Project Stats and the T2-A.1 host-independent MSBuild path repair are complete. Hosted checkpoint commit `9791d672c87c06c71e365d5433b4f847d6917046` passed Documentation, Windows, Ubuntu, macOS, and diagnostic coverage jobs; the Unix parsing blocker is removed.
- T2-B deterministic RAG-lite context routing is complete. Hosted checkpoint commit `28c895c366d9a8e451b8ed5c34c998322e3986fc` passed Documentation, Windows, Ubuntu, macOS, and diagnostic coverage jobs; the repository-foundation wave is complete.
- P1 planet semantic anchoring is accepted at checkpoint commit `6d7b02444bd44ad5cb1846e871d7170871a9d3e1`. Hosted run `30633659249` passed Documentation, Windows, Ubuntu, macOS, and diagnostic coverage jobs, and the owner accepted the four visual-evidence screenshots.
- S1 adaptive shell navigation is visually accepted and complete at checkpoint commit `705fef517834e609b485faca511e240e6dec0a8a`. Hosted run `30636973316` passed Documentation contracts, Windows, Ubuntu, macOS, and Diagnostic coverage jobs.
- T0-A Tarot semantic foundation is accepted at checkpoint commit `e8cb628d5dbbfb2a5fdc16b87fc4c3247bfb861f`. Hosted run `30788655353` passed Documentation contracts, Windows, Ubuntu, macOS, and Diagnostic coverage jobs.
- T1 first playable Tarot workspace is complete at checkpoint commit `4e7e3d61bc11b875af9fb5591f5a10ed986c8962`: real single-card and three-card in-memory readings, explicit reversal preference, responsive programmatic prototype cards, two selectable backs, localized inspection, and presentation-owned session state are ready for owner visual review. Hosted run `30791606505` passed Documentation contracts, Windows, Ubuntu, macOS, and Diagnostic coverage jobs.
- A3 partial-pack integration is functionally and visually accepted at commit `4977852287051c95945b55f78d18c263dc35de20`: Lupus Noctis contributes three accepted raster cards over the unchanged semantic reading, with Classic first, controlled fallback, localized overlays, and validated built-in resources. Single-card scale remains deferred to T-UX1 and native title-bar replacement to S2.
- AP0 asset-pack runtime architecture is complete at checkpoint commit `37dc91e24a8c73ec949312c21a684f5e2998398d`; hosted run `30806291467` passed Documentation contracts, Windows, Ubuntu, macOS, and Diagnostic coverage jobs.
- A6 is visually accepted by the owner: `major.lovers`, `minor.swords.nine`, and `minor.pentacles.two` are promoted into the Lupus Noctis partial pack, which now contains 12/78 production illustrations. The independent A7 authority / grief / discovery candidates remain Pending owner review.
- The actual branch and current HEAD are always reported by `eng/repo-baseline.ps1`; dynamic Git state is not owned here.
- The visual system is Astral Archive with paired Obsidian and Porcelain themes.

## Current Focus

Continue ART-LN with owner visual review of the three Pending A7 candidates. The post-A7 batch remains unselected, and AP1 does not start automatically.

## Preserved Contracts

- The golden Prague astronomy fixture and SwissEphNet boundary remain unchanged.
- Zodiac projection is counterclockwise; known-time charts use Placidus and the accepted orientation.
- UnknownTime has no houses or principal angles and retains its documented technical-noon planet policy.
- Runtime and user data belong in AppData or the platform user-data location; shipped assets belong in the repository.
- Tarot semantic decks, artwork packs, presentation skins, back variants, and interpretation sets have independent typed identities. T1 uses only honest programmatic prototype visuals and adds no persistence or interpretation prose.
- Lupus Noctis A0 and A1 remain rejected. The owner accepted all A2, A4, A5, and A6 cards; the built-in partial pack now owns 12/78 production illustrations and uses the existing programmatic face for omitted cards. A7 remains a bounded Pending review batch outside the manifest. Detailed card state, prompts, provenance, hashes, and casting policy belong only to `resources/assets/tarot/artwork-packs/lupus-noctis/LUPUS-NOCTIS.md`.
- Repository packs are versioned seed sources; the target runtime reads synchronized built-in and user packs from AppData. Discovery, no-delete synchronization, fingerprints, normalization, import, tooling, and packaging are staged under `ASSET-PACK-RUNTIME.md`; A3 direct output loading is temporary built-in-only behavior.
- Visual semantics belong to `VISUAL-DESIGN-SYSTEM.md`; Avalonia theme topology belongs to `THEMES.md`.
- Meaningful UI changes require manual smoke through the real application and real controls.

## Active Blockers

- Owner visual review of A7 is the current ART-LN gate; the post-A7 batch remains deliberately unselected. AP1–AP5 and PKG1 are staged work, not blockers for ART-LN.
