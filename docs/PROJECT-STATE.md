# Project State

| Metadata | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Role | Current repository handoff. |
| Read when | At the beginning of every nontrivial task. |
| Authoritative for | Current checkpoint, one current focus, preserved contracts, and active blockers. |
| Not authoritative for | History, the future stage catalog, code style, or exact test routes. |

## Current Checkpoint

- V1 chart visual design is accepted.
- V2 semantic shell and theme migration is accepted.
- T1-A repository documentation foundation is complete at checkpoint commit `77538a6157e269cde20b26ae3fa72764231a3858`.
- The actual branch and current HEAD are always reported by `eng/repo-baseline.ps1`; dynamic Git state is not owned here.
- The visual system is Astral Archive with paired Obsidian and Porcelain themes.

## Current Focus

T1-B repository verification foundation is complete. The next stage is T2: Project Stats and RAG-lite routing/context planning.

## Preserved Contracts

- The golden Prague astronomy fixture and SwissEphNet boundary remain unchanged.
- Zodiac projection is counterclockwise; known-time charts use Placidus and the accepted orientation.
- UnknownTime has no houses or principal angles and retains its documented technical-noon planet policy.
- Runtime and user data belong in AppData or the platform user-data location; shipped assets belong in the repository.
- Visual semantics belong to `VISUAL-DESIGN-SYSTEM.md`; Avalonia theme topology belongs to `THEMES.md`.
- Meaningful UI changes require manual smoke through the real application and real controls.

## Active Blockers

- Project Stats, RAG-lite exact routing, context planning, and retrieval evaluation are not implemented.
- GitHub Actions needs its first post-commit hosted-run confirmation across Windows, Linux, and macOS.
- No product feature is selected for implementation during the repository-foundation wave.
